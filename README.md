**IDEs**: VS CODE, Cursor AI, TRAE, Lovable etc.

**SOCIALS**
- Have Telergam user
- Twitter
- Farcaster
- Base app on mobile
- Zora

Now: Clone the repo into your designated directory.
- Open your desired IDE, then switch into the main directory of your cloned app.
- run **npm install**
- run **npm run dev** to ensure the repo is working correctly via the localhost (port depends on what is free)
- you can open a separate terminal (Bash or gitbash if installed)
- Then, via the IDE AI Agent, you can point to the @DemoComponents to reference and build your MiniApp (or MVP).

**@DemoComponents File** Why its important?

If you’re using an **AI-powered IDE** (like Trae, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot-based editors),
the `@DemoComponents` module becomes much more than a demo, it becomes a **rich learning and reasoning context** for the AI itself. 

Here’s how that works in practice:

### Understanding Through Context

AI-powered IDEs analyze your project files to understand patterns, imports, and relationships. When `@DemoComponents` is present,
it gives the AI a clear, working example of how Base and OnchainKit components behave — how the wallet connection is structured,
what hooks are used, what props are passed, and how transactions are rendered. This helps the AI “learn your stack” instantly,
so its future code suggestions are aligned with your architecture and Base ecosystem conventions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Guided Code Generation

Once the AI sees `@DemoComponents`, it can generate new code by **mimicking the existing patterns**. For instance:

* When you ask it to “create a SavingsGroupDashboard using OnchainKit,” it can base its layout, wallet handling, and component syntax on the demo files.
* It knows which imports to use (e.g., `import { ConnectWallet } from "@onchainkit/react"`) and how to manage provider wrappers.
* It can scaffold production components that follow the same event flow and styling conventions demonstrated in the demo.

Essentially, the demo code becomes a **reference model** that the AI copies intelligently, saving you from boilerplate repetition and syntax mistakes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Smart Refactoring and Integration

Because the demo components are modular, your AI IDE can suggest how to refactor them into production modules. For example:

* It might propose converting `DemoConnectWallet` into `VillageBankWalletAccess` with real logic and contract calls.
* It can automatically update imports, rename variables, and adapt UI elements without breaking your structure.
* It can help you transform placeholder demo data into live blockchain data sources.

This turns what would normally be manual refactoring into **guided transformation**, accelerating your build time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Continuous Feedback Loop

When you run or preview the app, your AI IDE can watch the same components in action and adjust its suggestions accordingly.
It learns that certain state hooks trigger wallet status, or that specific UI elements belong inside `BaseProvider`. So over time,
it doesn’t just autocomplete — it starts **reasoning contextually** about what each part of your code is trying to achieve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Real-World Benefit for You

In your case — building a **Digital Village Banking App** — the AI IDE could use `@DemoComponents` to:

* Instantly understand how wallet authentication works for smartphone users.
* Suggest secure ways to extend that logic for USSD users.
* Generate Base-ready smart contract interaction components based on the demo’s transaction patterns.
* Propose UI adjustments that keep your on-chain UX simple and culturally localized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In short

`@DemoComponents` gives your AI IDE a **reference map** — a living tutorial it can study and replicate. Instead of you teaching the
AI what every OnchainKit element does, it already has working examples right inside your codebase. That’s how an AI IDE can use the
demo layer as a foundation to help you build, refactor, and scale your blockchain app intelligently and safely.
